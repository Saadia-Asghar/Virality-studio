# TRENDING

### The Elite Attention Capture Platform (v2.5 Neural Engine)

Trending is a high-fidelity command center designed for the modern attention economy. It leverages **Gemini 2.0 Flash** to intercept viral signals, adapt conceptual seeds across social nodes, and audit content distribution with clinical precision.

## 🚀 Core Infrastructure

- **Neural Seed Workflow**: One idea, infinite adaptations for Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn.
- **Audience Radar**: Real-time competitor scanning, performance detail comparisons, and content gap forensics.
- **Trends Explorer**: Signal interception for breakout audio and emergent topics.
- **Post Reviewer**: AI-driven viral score auditing before deployment.
- **Ecosystem Analytics**: Macro-scale audience dynamics and conversion tracking.

## 👤 Target Audience (Who is it for?)
- **Solopreneurs**: Individuals building a personal brand and needing consistent, high-quality content.
- **Creators & Influencers**: Elite operators looking to dominate multiple platforms with minimal friction.
- **Growth Hackers**: Data-driven marketers who want to intercept trends and force algorithm favoritism.
- **Content Agencies**: Teams managing multiple client identities who require standardized, high-performance output.

## 📱 Supported Platforms (Which apps?)
Trending currently supports optimized signal synthesis for:
- **Instagram** (Reels & Captions)
- **TikTok** (Short-form logic & Trends)
- **LinkedIn** (Authority scripts & Professional nodes)
- **Twitter/X** (Contrarian threads & hooks)
- **Facebook** (Community engagement protocols)
- **YouTube** (Shorts & Long-form strategy)

## 🛠️ Deployment Protocol

1. **Neural Link**: Connect your Gemini API key in System Configuration.
2. **Platform Authorization**: Establish secure links via Deployment Ports (Instagram, TikTok, etc.).
3. **Activation**: Seed the engine with mock engagement data or begin real-time scanning.

## 🧬 Neural Architecture

Built with:
- **React 19 + TypeScript**: Solid, scalable frontend.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Premium, dark-mode-first aesthetic.
- **Firebase Auth & Firestore**: Persistent neural identities and global state sync.
- **Google Gemini API**: Industrial-grade LLM for content synthesis.
- **Lucide + Recharts**: High-fidelity visual telemetry.
